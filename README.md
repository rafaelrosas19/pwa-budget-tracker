# pwa-budget-tracker

## Description

This is a budget tracker application that allows the user to keep track of transactions at home or abroad. The significant advantage that comes to using this app as opposed to other budget apps is that it allows offline functionality. Consequently, if you find yourself in a location that does not have internet access, you can still continue to keep track of your expenses throughout the entire trip. Once you find an internet connection all of the information will be saved.
